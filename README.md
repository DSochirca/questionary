# Welcome to Questionary!

**Questionary** is a modern system which can allow the lecturers at TU Delft to teach their students to their utmost efficiency and effectiveness. _Lecturers_ can create _rooms_ for students, create _quizzes_ and see how students feel about the _lecture's speed_. _Students_ can join rooms and _ask questions_ they have about the lecture, as well as answering quizzes and voting the lecture's speed. Both _moderators and lecturers_ have privileged access to the rooms, and they can _edit, delete, mark questions as answered, and even ban ip addresses_.

## Description of project

**Questionary** is developed by students from **TU Delft** to make our lecturers' lives easier during the online teaching period. The system is general enough to be applicable to other educational institutions as well. Questionary uses a powerful and comprehensive **REST API built with Spring Boot**, as well as **JavaFX** as its UI platform.

Questionary may have reached version 1.1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our scrum board that we're anxious to add and other innovative workflows that we're planning to build into Questionary. So take Questionary out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite app for your institution!

## How to run it

Firstly, **clone** the repository or **download** the source code. Then open the repository in you preferred **IDE** and **build the project**. Once the project's build is done, you can run the server from `server/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/oopp/demo/DemoAplication.java`, and the client from `client/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/oopp/demo/MainApp.java`. 

The app is configured to run on **localhost** only. If you want it to be accessible from outside your local machine you should configure port forwarding and set the server's ip address and port in the server's application properties. Also, you need to change the requests' ip address (or server's domain, if you're using one) in ServerCommunication
